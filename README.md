# ChronoLedger ⏱️📒

ChronoLedger is a tamper-proof freelance activity logging system built using Java. It is designed to securely record, track, and verify developer or freelance work logs in a structured and immutable manner. This project is ideal for demonstrating core Java, file handling, OOPs, and system design concepts in a real-world use case.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Secure and append-only activity logging
- ✅ Immutable daily records for freelance/remote developer tasks
- ✅ Timestamped entries with local file storage
- ✅ JavaFX-based modern UI (Pro version)
- ✅ Tamper detection mechanism to verify file integrity
- ✅ Export activity logs to PDF/Excel (Pro version)
- ✅ Optional user login (for ChronoLedger Pro)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- JavaFX (for UI)
- File I/O (for persistent logs)
- OOP (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance)
- Hashing (for tamper detection)
- [Optional] Apache PDFBox / Excel APIs (for export)
